"""
In this exercise, you will create a program that reads words from the user until the
user enters a blank line. After the user enters a blank line your program should disï¿½play each word entered by the user exactly once. The words should be displayed in
the same order that they were entered. For example, if the user enters:
"""


# Read a  collection of words entered by the user. Display each word entered by
# the user only once, in the same order that the words were entered.

# Begin reading words into a list
words = []
word = input("Enter a word (blank line to quit): ")
while word != "":
    # Only add the word to the list if it's not already present in it
    if word not in words:
        words.append(word)

    # Read the next word from the user
    word = input("Enter a word (blank lune to quit): ")

# Display the unique words
for word in words:
    print(word)
