"""
An integer, n, is said to be perfect when the sum of all of the proper divisors of n is
equal to n. For example, 28 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2,
4, 7 and 14, and 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.
Write a function that determines whether or not a positive integer is perfect. Your
function will take one parameter. If that parameter is a perfect number then your funcï¿½tion will return true. Otherwise it will return false. In addition, write a main program
that uses your function to identify and display all of the perfect numbers between 1
and 10,000. Import your solution to Exercise 109 when completing this task.
