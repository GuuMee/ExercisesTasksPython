"""
In this exercise you will simulate 1,000 rolls of two dice. Begin by writing a funcï¿½tion that simulates rolling a pair of six-sided dice. Your function will not take any
parameters. It will return the total that was rolled on two dice as its only result.
Write a main program that uses your function to simulate rolling two six-sided
dice 1,000 times. As your program runs, it should count the number of times that each
total occurs. Then it should display a table that summarizes this data. Express the
frequency for each total as a percentage of the total number of rolls. Your program
should also display the percentage expected by probability theory for each total.
Sample output is shown below.
