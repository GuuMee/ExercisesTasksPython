An online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of $10.95
for the first item, and $2.95 for each subsequent item. Write a function that takes the
number of items in the order as its only parameter. Return the shipping charge for
the order as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main program that reads the number of
items purchased from the user and displays the shipping charge.
